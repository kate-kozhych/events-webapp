# events-webapp
Simplified Event Management System â€” Built with Java 21, Jakarta EE (JSF, JPA, Security, CDI), deployed on Payara with an H2 database. Features include secure authentication (PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512), profile management, and role-based access. Idea and system design fully created by me.
